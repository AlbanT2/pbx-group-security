Photobox represents a really good opportunity for security professionals who want to make a difference, who want to take their ideas to the next level.

The security team in Photobox is in a really privileged position. We have support from all levels of the organisation:

  - Board
  - CTO
  - Brand owners
  - Even support from the developers and technologists on the ground
  
There is a good understanding that security is important and we have to get it right. There are already great security actvities underway in Photobox, and there is an opportunity to take them to the next level.

What attracted me to work for Photobox was this environment, the ability to put in action the ability to scale security and make a difference. The ability to put into action the mission statement of Group Security, and 'secure our customers' magic moments'. That's very rare. Although there is a lot of investment in AppSec and InfoSec at the moment; these areas are definitely on the map; there aren't too many companies where you'll find the same opportunities as the Photobox group. 

The fact that we're hiring for these positions shows the company's ambition, and its forward-looking approach. Not only does Photobox want to protect what we're doing now, but we want to invest in, and protect the pipeline for 2020. The range of innovation at Photobox and its brands Moonpig, Hofmann, and PosterXXL will expand exponentially in the coming years and the job of Group Security is to protect ALL of that. If you think it's challenging to protect what we have now, imagine when we move to AI-driven decisions, huge networks of outsourcers and partners... a completely distributed working environment, developers pushing code tens of thousands of times a day--that's the world that we're heading towards, so if you wnat to be part of that journey... 

Some candidates may be earning more in other companies, but money isn't everything. I took a pay cut to come and work in Photobox, because there are more things in life than money. Yes, there is money to be made in Application Security today, it's a very in-demand market, but are you excited to go to work every day? Do you care about your company, its products, and its success? Do you have a passion for your work, and for the work you do with the amazing individuals on your team?

You might be working in a very successful organisation, but the chances are you are a relatively small cog in a very big machine, so your ability to influence and make a difference is limited.

In Group Security we don't have those limitations. It's about whether you can deliver your ideas, and I view my job as CISO is to make you more productive, to solve the problems so you can fulfil your potential, realise your ideas and execute them to the best of your ability. So if you're looking 

I tell everyone on the team that I expect them to be on a very steep learning curve, everyone should be learning all the time. We need to make sure we have a high ability to embrace new ideas. 

We have different parts, and sometimes we use a hospital analogy to identify those parts: A&E, triage, diagnostics, surgery, even mortuary services!

I believe in a professional organisation that can deliver repeatable, high quality results, and that's what Group Security delivers.

Fundamentally, why should you join our team? You're one of us! A rebel, you want to do things differently. You have great ideas and you want a workplace where your ideas can come to life. 

To be clear: everyone in the team is not expected to be a Duracell bunny, accelerating at maximum speed. The balance and effectiveness of the team lies within its multi-cultural, multi-experienced, and multi-personality composition.
