## Why challenges?

Why are we asking the applicants to these new roles to take up the various challenges we've devised? Why are we getting them to provide all this extra information before we even meet them?

The biggest reason is it's fair. CVs aren't always a good reflection of a person's capabilities. CVs can be wildly exaggerated and they don't always show a person's true potential. CVs can make it hard for recruiters to make a fair assessment.

The initial interview doesn't always work that well; you should be able to discuss a project of which you all have experience. 

This is where the challenges come in: when candidates excel at particular challenges, at interview stage we then have something tangible to discuss: their thoughts and reactions to the challenges.

The challenges also allow the candidates to shine. Some candidate will react very quickly under pressure, where others will want time to reflect, to do some research. To be honest that's what we want; we don't particularly want someone who has all the answers straight away; we want someone who can find all the answers. And if they need more time, even a couple of days, as long as the quality of their output is really good, that's the person we're looking for. 

The challenges should also be fun; the candidates should enjoy them, as well as learning from them. Even if they don't make it to the end of the selection process, hopefully the challenges will guide them to where there are gaps in their skill set and show them why this job isn't the right one for them.

How can we manage the challenge of the challenges? How do we create the right questions, that the candidate wil be happy and interested to answer? In a way, the challenges will highlight the opportunities and advantages of working with Photobox Security Group. The challenges should represent what we do on a daily basis, and should give the candidates a feel for the job they will be doing.  We must avoid the horror stories from other corporations, who use irrelevant challenges that focus on knotty intellectual, problem-solving capabilities that are worlds away from the realities of the job being advertised.

This process will also allow us to learn what other people have done and how our own recruitment process can improve. In Photobox Group Security we believe in openness, and this open discussion of our recruitment process is an example of that culture in action.
