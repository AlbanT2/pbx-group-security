## Why write blog posts for the Photobox Group Security website?

This is more of a memo to the current Group Security team, but it gives an idea of our current thinking for this website.

One of the biggest challenges in any company is how best to communicate with staff in a way that really keeps them informed of what's going on. What is very interesting in the Photobox group is the remarkable lack of politics within the company. This is quite rare. The politics, the games, and the attrition that occurs because of company politics, seems to be absent from Photobox Group Security.

We do have, that also happens everywhere is a lack of abiity to propagate informations. That is caused by many factors; by culture, technology, procedures, or a lack of time to properly disseminate information. In a way, if people don't know what's happening, it's not because of a political decision not to share that information, it's because the infrastructure isn't there to share it. 

This blog, this website, and the data on it, are building blocks for that infrastructure, and the security and technology staff in Photobox will be the builders . Here you will see the entire Security team talking about what they do and how they do it; their successes and frustrations, their challenges, their problems, and their achievements. 

One of the things I've learned is that it is easier to collaborate internally, but externally. Which is to say, you can collaborate with your team by speaking in an open and distributed way on an external forum. This means that information reaches its target more easily. When you lose a bit of control over who accesses the information, you gain access to many more people than would otherwise be possible, both within and outside your team.  Another benefit is a change in tone; you gain a more human voice that can also increase your reach and allows much better communiocation. This mirrors the benefits of Open Sourcing, which promotes a deeper level of collaboration within the same company. It's only when you open source a particular piece of code that you see the level of internal collaboration skyrocketing across a company. 

I expect every Group Security team member to write blog posts about what they do, and post them here. Just check that your blogs contain NO proprietary information, no customer data, no internal passwords or keys, etc. 

This blog will be where we communicate. Group Security should start to see items discussed at our weekly meetings appearing in blog posts. 

Another great advantage of this blog is that it will allow us to reach a much wider community. If there's a problem and we share it here, we access a much wider network of expertise and advice than is available in-house. If you're struggling with a Kanban dashboard, post the issues in a blog and wait for the advice to roll in!

The blog will help the recruitment process by demonstrating that we are open in a very visible and quantifiable way. At the moment, we can say we are open, but until we start sharing more information in a public forum such as this blog, we are not really open. It's only when you share data that people can see our openness in action. Potential candidates will see that the company empowers and allows the team to do this, and they'll think, "That's the company I want to work for". Hopefully, this blog will lead us to one or two recruitment success stories. 

The question is: can we get it to work, and will every team member write posts about what they do?
