## Why write blog posts for the Photobox Group Security website?

This is more of a memo to the current Group Security team, but it gives an idea of our current thinking for this website.

One of the biggest challenges in any company is how best to communicate with staff in a way that really keeps them informed of what's going on. What is very interesting in the Photobox group is the remarkable lack of politics within the company. This is very rare. The politics, the games, and the attrition that occurs because of company politics, 

We do have, that also happens everywhere is a lack of abiity to propagate informations. That is caused by many factors; by culture, technology, procedures, or a lack of time to properly disseminate information. In a way, if people don't know what's happening, it's just that the infrastructure isn't there. 

This blog, this website, and the data on it, are building blocks for that infrastructure. Here you will see the entire Security team talking about what they do and how they do it; their successes and frustrations, their challenges, their problems, and their achievements. 

One of the things I've learned is that it is easier to collaborate internally, but externally. Which is to say, you can collaborate with your team by speaking in an open and distributed way on an external forum. This means that information reaches its target more easily. When you lose  a bit of control over who accesses the information, you gain access to many more people than would otherwise be possible, both within and without your team.  Another benefit is a change in tone; you gain a more human voice that can also increase your reach and allows much better communiocation. This mirrors the benefits of Open Sourcing, which promotes a deeper level of collaboration within the same company. It's only when you open source a particular piece of code that you see the level of internal collaboration skyrocketing across a company. 

I expect every GS team member to write blog posts about what they do, and post them here. Just check that your blogs contain NO proprietary information, no customer data, no internal passwords or keys, etc. 

This will be where we communicate. At our weekly meetings, we should start to see the things we discuss appear on the blogs. 

Other great advantage--allows us to reach a much wider audience. If there's a problem and u share it here, 

Also help the recruitment process--share the data--see the message in action

Candidates who saw one of these posts--will see the open culture in action and will apply as a result of this.
