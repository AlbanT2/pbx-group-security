Everything is a project

One of the key concepts of what we have at group security is, basically, the idea that everything that we do is a project. This kind of easy when you think about implementation projects, let's say, when you are doing a backup, or we doing a doctrace deployment, or we doing a firewall review, or we are doing, even things like, pentest, you can think as a project. But we actually extend that, to the view that for example, network support, its initial response it as a project, where technical writing and maintaining Jira and compliance are projects, where admin functions or even execs creations, or senior level management parts, they are projects. 

And the reason we do that, is because we need a standardize way to map all our environment, that goes from planning, to execution, to completion, through budget, through resources, everything. So, once you find that you can think of a project as these buckets that you can use to map things to, you realize that what we really have is a project, basically that is has a brief, a set of objectives that has very clear deliverables, and this can be yearly. You can have yearly projects, that get renewed every year, which is also a great way to adjust and measure success. You can have OKR's, you can have KPI's, you can have budget requirements. And you also have things like resources, and the resources are people, are tools, services, other teams that you have to interact with, so anything that is required for the particular project to succeed.

And what you don't have this environment, where this becomes part of the daily activities, and what we are doing is we are investing in a team to manage the whole process, to automate it so hopefully, eventually using a Jira based workflow we will get the whole thing in a quite of automated state where it just happens and actually, adds value to everybody.
