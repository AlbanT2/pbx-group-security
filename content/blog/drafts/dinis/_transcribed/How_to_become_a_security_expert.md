How to become a security expert

The best way to really get your head around security is to exploit security vulnerabilities.  So, the target audience of this is good professionals, you know, developers, that have a good understanding of technology, that are moving into the security space. And we have a number of them in our team. 

Basically, one of the responsibilities that we have is how can we take this professional and take them to the next level. So, there is a multiple stage approach to do this. And I'd say that the first one is to write, is to find the vulnerabilities, then you write the exploits for those vulnerabilities, then you really understand the variation of the exploits, and then you try to fix them. And that workflow will walk you through a lot of paradigm shifts that you need to do. So, at the end, you'll understand the problems of data, like data validation, or data handling, the problems with data injections. You'll understand the problems with authentication authorization. You'll understand the problems of trusting who has a data, and who is making decisions. You'll understand the problem of encryption and protecting data, and the value of assets. You'll understand risk conditions. Which is basically... You'll also understand the human element and the workflows, and the development, and the use of the pipeline. So, basically, that takes you to, hopefully, those paradigm shifts. 

So, how do you do it? We provide security and a number of tools, and techniques, and environments, for that to happen. The first one, I'd say is books. I think books are a great way to learn. We probably get any books that the team wants, so our library is already quite showed in, and we'll probably gladly more. Because books are basically masterclasses, so, subject master experts, right? So, that's where you should really start to that. And books are the best technology to learn, due to its undivided focus and ability to explain the information.

Now, the next thing, you do hands on exercises. So, we use Avatron which is a Hackathon platform, which we have available for everybody. And basically, we have a couple of career paths that you should that. And that will also allow you to get hands on experience on the vulnerabilities. And the Hackathon challenges can, actually, be quit trick, right? It's quite a great learning experience. And the reality is that, in the beginning it does matter if you look at all the solutions, because sometimes just going to the exercise and understand it, it gives a lot of the a-ha moments. So, in a way, is more important to see the solution, and complete the exercise doing it yourself. Because even if you do it manually, you actually learn a lot. You do a lot of paradigm shifts.
And the next pat, the next phase. Is when you actually like the exploit. So, that's when you start to code and like the exploits yourselves. Now, the exploit are actually tests, in a way, they are a security test. And that's where is gets interesting! Because once you can do that, you have a way to replicate the findings. And this is not easy, now if you want to go to that level. Then, you write the exploits in a testing framework because it allows you look at the ability. Which gets very powerful, when you actually go and fix stuff.

Another good exercise is to take some applications, like for example, the Juice Shop or other vulnerable by design applications. And basically, first exploit them, and then write fixes for them. And that is very powerful, because it allows you to understand that actually fixing things and creating security protectors is, actually, much harder than actually breaking it.

But I do think that unless you start from the breaking site, you struggle. Because you don't know what to test, or even you don't have that instinct to know "Hm... Iâ€™m not sure I have enough coverage". Because you know the gaps of your understanding. 

So, that how you do it. So, the faster you do that loop, the more you become a security professional, and the more you start to understand what it takes to actually do an application in network security. 

One more thing and also important. A part of your learning curve is to ask questions, find people that you respect or you like, ask. Every good security professional I know loves to teach. And, you know, they'll always remember that. They learn thyself, they were in that learning curve. So, don't feel afraid to ask questions. And finally, present. The best way to learn is to teach. So, one your the final stages of learning is to, actually, present and produce materials that when you present to your peers, they respect it. In a way, that is the highest form of compliment. And that is what you want to achieve, is when you can create something, that peers or people that you respect, also respect itself. And they appreciate it, and you teach something. And it's also, to be honest, the best job interview ever, when you actually are presenting or you get to talk about something that you have presented or you've done, right? So, that's basically what you really want. Fundamentally, to get to a point where you are actually presenting your research.
