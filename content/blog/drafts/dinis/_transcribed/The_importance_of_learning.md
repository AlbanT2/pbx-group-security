The importance of learning

One of the most important activities every member of the team should do, is to learn. Everybody must find ways to incorporate learning into their day to day activities. If you are not learning, you are not improving as an individual, as a person, as a colleague, as a professional. The key is to align your learning with what you need to do professionally, and what the team requires from you. That challenge, is in a way, the most interesting part of your work. 

The hard part of the journey is to be able to live with the uncertainties of learning. When you set off on an accelerating learning path you tend to respond to tensions. It is sometimes very hard to have the confidence to stick to the path, especially when you don't understand the contingencies. You try something and that leads you to something else, and you do that, and that leads to something else, and so all these tensions keep revealing themselves. 

The reality is that these tensions can point out the right directions, and the challenge is to accept that that is okay. Typically, a problem that you tried to solve in the beginning, will probably only be solved by something you do at a later stage. Of course, you can't deviate too much, therefore the skill is knowing where to stop. The key is knowing when following that tension is not going to work. Failure, or not succeeding is part of the journey, and if you don't fall over then you just aren't trying. The person that never made a mistake never made anything, right? 

The challenge with learning is actually having that confidence that it will work out okay. Sometimes you have to be a little bit irrational, you have to be a little bit blind to the whole implications, because or else you will never start in the first place. In a way, having a certain level of irrationality is actually very important, because that's what allows you to start down that path.


The philosophy of our team, is that everybody should be a leader. Everybody must take ownership of their own actions, ownership of their own areas. You do that both by being good at those areas and by accepting that you need to learn a lot, and go on this big learning curve, which is what we encourage every team member to do. We work in a very technical field, and it's very important to really understand the media that we are dealing with. You are part of a technical team which means that you need to have a wide set of knowledge, because that what allows you to have the priors, and fundamentally understand what is possible and what is not. Not only that, we need to continue to learn about business.

Maintaining the drive to learn is fundamental to your continued development. One of my personal challenges is to make sure that I continue to learn. Remember learning is a game, there is a technique, there are ways to do it well, there are ways to be more efficient. Everybody's personal journey should include learning how they learn best, and finding the techniques that are the most effective. Some people are working best at home, some people from a Caf√©, some in an office. Different types of learning may suit quiet environments some power environments with a lot of activities and organization. 

Aim to learn something new every week, develop your personal plan that includes the things that you want to learn next. Align that with the activities that we are doing in the group security. The good news is, there are so many areas, and so much space in group security that it's actually up to the individual to identify the most important topics and conquer them. That is why we provide the space for that to happen, because we trust you to become what we need you to be.
