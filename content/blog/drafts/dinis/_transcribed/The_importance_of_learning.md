The importance of learning

One of the most important properties, so I can put in activities, I believe every member of the team should do, is to learn. And everybody has to find ways where learning is a co-part of their day to day activities. If you are not learning, you are not improving as an individual, as a person, as a colleague, as a professional. The key is to align your learning with what you need to do professionally, and what the team requires you to do. That, is in a way, the interesting part of. 

The hard part is to be able to live with the uncertainties of learning. One of the things that happen, when you go into an accelerating learning path, is that you tend to go on tensions, and sometimes is very hard to, have to confidence and keep north, when you don't understand contingencies. You try something and that leads you to something else, and you do that, and that leads to something else, and so go on all these tensions. 

And the reality, is that the tensions are pointing the right directions, and that is okay. Because in the reality, sometimes, a problem that you tried to solved in the beginning, will actually be solved by something you do at the latest age. Of course, you can't deviate too much. And then the key is knowing where to stop. The key is knowing when that tension is not going to work. And, you then, need to go back and that's okay. Failure or not succeeding is part of the experiment, and if you don't fail over teeth sometimes, you know, it's part of learning.

The challenge with learning is actually having that confidence, having that confidence that it will work okay. And sometimes you have to be a little bit irrational, you have to be a little bit blind to the whole implications, because or else you will never start it, on the first place. In a way, having a certain level of irrationality is actually very important, because that's what allows you to go down that path.

Drive to that learning is fundamental. And one of my challenges is to make sure that, I continue to learn, including continue to be very technical, because we are a technical bunch, you know. We work in a very technical field, and it's very important to really understand the media that we are dealing. Although that is a technical can also be learning about new resources. It can also be learning about business. Learning how things work. 

But in technology, it also means, one of the fundamentals of technology, and it means that you do need to have a wide set of knowledge, because that what allows you to have the priors, and basically understand how to read things. And fundamentally understand what is possible and what is not possible. 

The idea of our team, is that everybody should be a leader. Everybody should go to take ownership of their own actions, ownership of their own areas. And you do that by being good at those areas, and by accepting that you need to learn a lot, and you go on this big learning curve, which is what we encourage every team member to do.

And finally, the key of these is also learning how to learn. Learning is a game, there is a technique, there is better ways to do that, way there are more efficient. Everybody's personal journey is to also make sure that they learn how they learn best, and they find ways where they are the most effective. Some people are working from homes, some people is working from a Caf√©, some people digesting information in a particular way, this is working in an office, or being in a power environment with a lot of activities and organization. 

Everybody learns different, the key is that you learn something new every week, and you have a nice personal plan that includes the things that you want to learn next, and you should align that with the activities that we are doing in the group security. The good news is there is so much so areas, and so much space in group security that, it's actually up to the individual to find those things and to get better at that. Because, you know, we provide the space for that to happen.
