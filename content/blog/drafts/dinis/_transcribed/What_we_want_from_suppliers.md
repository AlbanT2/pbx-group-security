What we want from a security vendor.

What we really want from the company supervising our services or products is a partner. We want somebody that looks at us as an entity that they strategically need to help to make the most out of that technology. And this is something that I have to say, unfortunately, some of our existing suppliers are not matching. 

We already have a couple of spectacular success stories, in terms of, some of our suppliers, who are what I would call, proper partners. So, these are suppliers who have allocated a resource to us, who have given time to actually, spend time with us, to understand how the best is about technology, to understand the best ways to actually consume the products to make the most out of it, and to the point where there are on a slack channel with us, they are available for questions, they share information from other customers with us, regarding what is going on, what the best is of technology. That's what we want. They find ways to save money, so we get the best of the technology, of course, and they also find ways for us to use more products from them. 

The point here is not show a change of suppliers, we want them to be healthy, but we also want to make sure that we get value from money from them. And there is a number of suppliers that that's not happening, and this is literally what I want to see happening, I want to redefine a lot of our current suppliersâ€™ relationships. So that we have this. We want suppliers, with whom we can slack, that we can contact, that will teach us the best use of their products, that can take questions in real time. That are able to capture those questions and put them on webforms, that we can learn from each other, that we can create connections with other consumers. 

So, that we can gain knowledge, share experiences, and that is really what we want from suppliers. It's this. And if you are not one of those, you basically are in a situation where we'll be actively looking at replacing, because the amount of value that we get from you is not that high, and we can't them justify the investment, because we simply don't get the value. And a lot of the times, it's actually because the supplier has not worked with us enough, to actually make sure that we get the most value out of his tools. Because a lot of these tools are complicated, they take workload, they take all sorts of skills to actually make it happen. 

And I got to say, the final thing, is that we also want supplies that can also provide resources at a decent rate or are able to create them, or educate them, so that, sometimes we can just throw a couple resources to it. You know, I say people, that are actually able to do the leg and make sure things are implemented. And some suppliers try to charge very high consulting rates for this, kind of from very high specialized engineers, and that's actually not efficient, because we don't need those high specialized engineers, we actually just need somebody who can take responsibility for deploying it or making it happen, or even configuring it, right?

So that's what we want from suppliers in 2018.
