Why we ask candidates to submit their answers in the GitHub repo

Git is a major transformation technology. It, actually, embodies some of the best things that technology can do. And when you fully understand how GitHub works, it's a great way to make really important paradigms shift. 

Git was developed by Linus Torvalds, the inventor of Linux, and the story is very interesting, especially, due to the way that it changed how software development works. I actually think that Git, is probably, one of the biggest, Linus contributions to the world. Because its distributed format, it changes how you create content, changes how you develop and changes how we actually create in our society, not just software.

Unfortunately, I don't think Git is as widely used as it should be, because it's still not fully understood. And even technology, sometimes the circles, even the technology circles, the private ownership still occurs as much as it should.  So, the reason we ask to candidates to submit to Git is because we want to make sure that they understand it, and also to make sure that if they don't, they'll learn it. So, they'll get better.

So, using GitHub, which is basically a platform that on top of Git, it's a really powerful way to create and manage content. Because you have a version control, content driven creation, and that is the big part on shift. So, basically, what a Git repo gives us is also, the story capitalization. For example, I expect to see a lot of commits, I expect to see a lot of changes, I expect to see the history of the candidates, how they think, how they operate. Do they do continuous deployment? Do they build systems? So, for example, just putting a file up there, for me it's not that interesting. What I think it's interesting, for example, you go to create a site that contains the content. If they build their code with tests. If they are creative, it they stoned the challenge we provided them, or if they go that extra mile. 

So, providing answers on Git, and in GitHub, provides a great way for the right candidates to join, but also a very easy way for us to actually try and quickly evaluate the candidates and determine if they have what we are looking for.

Ultimately, Git and GitHub are the ultimate leveler, they are no way to hide, it's open. It's a place where the true essence, and in a way, soul, vision and talent of a person should really shine there.
