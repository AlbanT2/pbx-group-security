Why we ask candidates to submit their answers in the GitHub repo

Git is a major transformative technology. It embodies some of the best things that technology can do. When you fully understand how GitHub works you can make important paradigm shifts. The reason we ask to candidates to submit to Git is because we want to make sure that they understand it, and ensure that if they don't, they learn it. So, they'll get better.

Git was developed by Linus Torvalds, the inventor of Linux, and its impact is fascinating because it changed how software development works. In my opinion, Git is one of the biggest Linus contributions to the world. Its distributed format changes how we create content, changes how we develop and changes how we actually create in our society, not just software.

Unfortunately, I don't think Git is as widely used as it should be, because it's still not fully understood. Even in technology circles private ownership still dominates. Using GitHub, which is a platform that runs on top of Git, is a really powerful way to create and manage content. Git provides version control and that is the big part of the shift. 

A Git repo gives us the back story. I expect to see a lot of commits, I expect to see a lot of changes, I expect to see the history of the candidates, how they think, how they operate. Do they do continuous deployment? Do they build systems? So, for example, just putting a file up there is not that interesting. What I think it's interesting, for example, you go to create a site that contains the content. If they build their code with tests. If they are creative, it they stoned the challenge we provided them, or if they go that extra mile. 

So, providing answers on Git, and in GitHub, provides a great way for the right candidates to join as well as a very easy way for us to quickly evaluate the candidates and determine if they have what we are looking for.

Ultimately, Git and GitHub are the ultimate leveller, they is no way to hide, it's open. It's a place where the true essence, and in a way, soul, vision and talent of a person can really shine.
