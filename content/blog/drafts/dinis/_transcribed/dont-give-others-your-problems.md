Problem transfer:  Don't Give Others Your Problem

One of the greatest statements that resonated with me at a Photobox leadership meeting was "do not give others your problems."  The term "others" refers to clients, customers, team members and other divisions of the company.  If you are working on specific tasks with deadlines, it can be very easy to transfer your to-do list to others.  This is not a form of delegation but rather a problem that could have been solved by you.  Theoretically, it places a tax onto someone else's work load.  

An example of how this might occur could be in project management situation.  If you look at most project management activities, the team members work on faith-baed data.  So it is necessary to have weekly or even daily briefing meetings to bring everyone up to speed on the progress of the activities.  Your job as the lead it to present the problem and also have possible solutions to offer to the team. That way, the team can see that you have done some background work on the issue, captured the data, and presented it as "this is what is happening because this is what I am reading."

Anther reason not to tranfer problems to others is that is greatly slows down the completion process of the team.  It is easy to ask team members "what is happening" when looking at data but it is the actually the easy way out. It becomes a very complicated question for others to digest when they may not have the same mental picture of how you may be viewing the situation.  A lot of time would need to be taken to bring the team up to speed on the understanding of the issue. It is almost like two negatives occurrig at the same time.  So the key here is to always look for solutions that make tackling the project fluid, providing your team with what they need to and how much you are asking them to complete.

It makes excellent business sense to handle project tasks in-house.  Centralizing the work within the team or company brings a sense of pride to be able to say that "we do that here in our own company."  And it is usually more productive, because you can get more resources, more talent, more people, and more capabilities from within.  So, I find that it is very important as the project is mapped out, you can see the connections between the different elements, the connections between the different objectives, the different bids and who is delegating and who is working hard.  Especially, if you look at project management, one of the hardest parts is not always about what is going on, as I stated above, but also assigning tasks correctly, finding great solutions to get information or material, having a good team, and always providing the capabilities to perform. We are like the boysâ€™ scout role, we always leave the campsite better than we left.  We should be striving to positiviely impact our team, our company, and our customers on a daily basis with better business interactions.
