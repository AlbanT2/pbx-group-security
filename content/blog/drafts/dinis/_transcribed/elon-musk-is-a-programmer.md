Elon is a great programmer. I just read Elon Musk's biography, which i highly recommend. And, one of the very interesting takeaways, which I didn't realized before, was how Elon Musk is a really good programmer and a really good designer. And you can see that throughout the book, you can see that through his history. Where Elon Musk came from a program background hero, to love to code. And although, there is an infinite discussion on whether, as more professional programmer come true, what was actually good. The interesting part is that he, fundamentally, knew how to write code at a deep level, all the way from his childhood. And, you can see that, because you see that on his mind thinking, he's like a programmer. He breaks problems into logical bits, he finds out what it needs to take to solve those problem, and he, then, breaks them down into small chunks, and executes them one at the time, and each one leads to the other. 

I also think, he is very good at understanding the compound effect of programming or problem solving, which, basically, means that once you have ten problems, actually, the seventh or eighth problem would actually be addressed on improved by something that you solve in the first couple of problems. It's not unlike the microchip designers that know that the next version of the microchip, will be designed based on the version you are designing now, so you benefit from scale. And that, you can see on how he thinks, on how he operates.

The other big thing is design. And he has designed the lots in a way that they have that, which is design the experience, design not just about how it looks, which is, of course, also very important. But the function, and understanding that is about how things work. And he designs the experience, and basically everything, which is where things get interesting. So, he doesn't... you know, if you look at Elon Musk and how the companies operate, you don't just build a device, you build a factory to build a device, in a way the whole process itself is the machine, in that. And that's very important, because it's the machine that builds the machine. 

It's just like an article that I've read recently about Amazon. It's about creating those environments where you can actually iterate very fast specific areas and of course, self-contain wisely. 

And, of course, the final part, that also Musk grab from programming, which is also complied as agile in the webs, is the whole integrate fast. It's basically to integrating and learning and learning... and that's what you get. We should look at the technology innovation from the companies that he leads, Tesla, others, is the fact that they learn so fast. They use software, in a way, much more than other companies. The fact the cars today still don't auto update themselves, shows how that... For example, Tesla, in a car are able. And it's not just about software, I was talking about the basic stuff, and they do the same thing with satellites, you know. They keep pushing, they'll put auto updates into satellite that is on space, they do that, once you done that other life, and that becomes second nature. So, deploying very fast, is what they are doing. But they are doing it on the hardware, and power tools levels.

And those three things are what actually make... I think are one of the main key reasons for his success. And of course, the final audience is drive, and the fact that he leads by example, and works crazy hours.  Although, I do think that has to be another balance, where he is also very focus on the environments that people work, and the environment that you do think that, sometimes if you create the periods where people get into the zone, and are happy productive, sometimes can be as effective, if no, more. Which is, basically, when you create environments where you like performing, on a high performing team, with fluidity, where everything flows, and everybody is align in the same direction. The challenge, of course, is how to do that, right? It is actually what we are trying to do here, at group security, we try to be one of those highly effective teams, that can make a difference.

 So, yes, it's very inspiring, and it's very interesting to see how he thinks and how the quality and updatability, and design, and the energy, is actually creating things that are literally changing the world.
