I just read Elon Musk's biography, which I highly recommend. One of the interesting takeaways, which I did not know before reading, was that Musk is an excellent programmer and designer. It is evident throughout the book as he reveals his history. Musk came from a programing background, he loved to code. 
Fundamentally he knew how to write code at a deep level, beginning in his childhood. It is evident in his thinking, he thinks like a programmer. He breaks problems into logical bits, he finds out what it will take to solve those problems. Then he breaks them down further into small chunks, and executes them one at the time.
I also think that he is very good at understanding the compound effect of programming, or problem solving. By that I mean that you may start with ten problems but, in fact, the seventh or eighth problem can often be addressed by something that you used to solve the first couple of problems. It's not unlike the microchip designer scenario, where they know that the next version of the microchip will be designed based on the version they are designing now. You benefit from scale, and that philosophy is revealed by how he thinks and operates.
His other big skill is design. His approach is to design the experience, not just the looks, which are, of course, also very important. He deliberates the function, with a great level of understanding about how things work. If you examine Musk and how his companies operate, you see that he doesn’t just build a device, he builds the factory to build the device, in a way the whole life-cycle process itself is the machine. This is very important, because ultimately, it's the machine that builds the machine. 
It's just like an article that I've read recently about Amazon. It's about creating those environments where you can iterate very quickly in specific areas and, of course, self-contain wisely. 
The final philosophy that Musk adopted from programming, which is also referred to as agile in the web world, is the whole integrate fast concept. It is dependent on learning and then integrating that knowledge and then learning again. Just look at the technological innovation coming from the companies that he leads, for example, Tesla and the others. Their success is based on the fact that they learn so fast. They use software, in a way, that outstrips the attempts by other companies. 
Tesla cars auto update themselves. It's not just the software, it’s about how they apply it, they do the same thing with satellites, you know. They keep pushing, they put auto updates into satellites in space. Deploying fast has become second nature and they are doing it at the hardware, and power tools levels.
So, programming skills, deep design and integrate fast are the three key factors that, I believe, have contribute to Musk’s success. Not to dismiss his incredible drive, and the fact that he leads by example and works crazy hours. Personally, I do think that there must be balance. Musk is also very focused on the environment that people work in. The environment matters, if you create the time and space where people can get into the zone and are happily productive, this impacts how effective a company can be. 
I think our challenge is to implement these same skills in addition to creating environments where people enjoy performing and are part of a high performing team. We must nurture fluidity, where everything flows and everybody is aligned in the same direction. The challenge, of course, is how to do that, right? This is what we are motivated to create here, at group security, we aim to be one of those highly effective teams, that can make a difference.
So, yes, it is very inspiring and interesting to get insights into how Musk thinks and how the quality and updatability; the design and the energy, is creating outcomes that are literally changing the world.
