Using freelancers for shorts.
Using freelancers for small tasks.

One of the practices that we are going quite effectively at group security is the use of the freelancer that we hire for very specific tasks. In a way, we are doing the gig economy, we are using the fact that there's a huge amount of spectacular talent out there that is not available, unless they can work on their terms, on their timing and when they are available. We've enabled to successfully create an environment to nurture this, which is an environment that is created using the Upwork platform, where we basically negotiate an hourly rate and we assign a number of hours to the individuals to use on the task.

Now the interesting thing about this, is that you really depend on the individual, it really depends on the person's ability to just figure out what is the right question that he can answer, and how they can get on with it.

And what is interesting, is that the right individual will take a task, analyze it, think about it, ask couple questions and get on with it. Where the ones that don't really work out, are the ones that paralyzed by the lack of brief, and or paralyzed by the fact that sometimes the instructions are not very detail and very actionable. And the irony is that's by design. 
There is a point, where if you create tasks that are so obvious, or so well determined, then sometimes is faster for you to do that, than to delegate. So, what we really want it to create problems, to create challenges, to create specific requests that somebody can take on, and run with it. And that's where we had very success. We have already a number of amazing individuals in the team that have been able to take these tasks, run with it and produce some spectacular outcomes. So, if you are joining the team to do that, or if you want to join the team to do those things, it can be very interesting. You can be doing some really interesting work and the idea is to leverage your professionalism, leverage your professional experience, what you are really good at, what makes you special. That's what we really want to nurture. Because, fundamentally, if you love what you do, you gonna do it much better, with much more care and much more detail, which is what we are after. And, it works really well. 

So, if you are joining the team, basically your job is to find your spot. And, actually, we give you a wide area for task to be picked. Sometimes, it doesn't even mean that the first one that we ask, is actually the best one for you. The team is very empowering, the team is really happy to help and you should leverage our resource.

Basically, we have a very high tolerance for questions. We love questions. We love when people ask stuff. And specially, when they learn. I guess what we have very low tolerance is for team members that don't learn or individual that struggle with just getting stuff done. And it's fair enough, some individuals are just... That's not what they are for, they are very good executioners. I guess what we are really looking for is those person that have bilateral thinking, that ability to think outside the box. And then just to produce something really special to the end.

That's our freelance world.
