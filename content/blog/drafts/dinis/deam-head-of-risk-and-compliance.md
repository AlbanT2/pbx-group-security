My dream Head of Risking Compliance profile. 

So now, in the mix of recruitment process we have, I we have quite a good number of candidates. I'd like to share some of my thoughts on what would be, for me, the ideal Head of RC.

So, the first major point is for the candidate to have a really good vision for how risk of compliance can be an enabler for the business, something that actually makes the business grow faster. And basically, simplifies processes. Fundamentally, managing risks and being complying is just, at its core, an operational practice. It's the ability to execute a number of rules, related to regulations, very effectively and very professionally.
 
I'm a very big believer of a strong approach machine, which is basically an efficient process driven workflow. So, if you look for example, risk management is the ability to understand what are the implications of the decisions that are being made and allow the owners, the business owners of the assets that we are talking about, to make informed decisions.

So fundamentally, it's about data, being able to collect the right amount of data, filter and analyze it, and present it in ways that can be easily consumes, either text, graphs, infographics, etc. So, risk management is the whole workflow that allows that to occur.
Basically, it's the workflow that allows the risk decisions to be made to match the risk up entitled the company. And that's something that need to be done from the lowest level of the organization all the way to the top. From individual on the ground all the way to the board, the C-level executives and them, fundamentally, the boards. Which is the ultimate risk arbitrator of this whole thing. 

So, traditional, risk has been a very negative thing, because teams are allergic to it, nobody wants to own risk, and nobody wants to really embrace it head on, and usually, it becomes a big bureaucratic exercise, which the worst part, a lot of times, is not driven by reality, is driven, sometimes, by a perception of the reality. People can't get information in reality, because the risk teams tend to be separate. It means they tend to live on a separate reality, because they don't actually get real data. 

So real data, should be in real time, driven by the actual operational parts of where that data is created, that then feeds a whole number of dashboards analytics, who them allows you to make good decisions.
What we need to do from a group security point of view, is make this process really smooth. We need create an environment, when these is effectively implemented in teams, they can actually move faster, because they know the rules of the game. They know how to get things done. They know the processes to go through and they allow, in way, the systems to work without group secure intervention. That's what you want. You want a workflow, where somebody wants to do something, the rules of engagement are hard to find, they create a risk ticket, these are documented and go to the right person for risk acceptance, group security approves. The techops for example implements its, and that all should be a very smooth process. In our case is going to be powered by a bunch of scripts, but its the smoothness of that needs to be very efficient. 
And the compliance part is basically, the ability to map the current rules and regulation that we have to review, from a government point of view. The big core is GPR but we also have to be PCA compliant, for example. 

And fundamentally, I view those GPR as a competitive advantage, we get it right and we'll be better than our competitors. We will be able to show that we care about data and our customers magic moments and be able stream line a lot of the process. Because in a way, a lot of times, the reason why compliance is hard, is because we are looking for inefficiencies within the system. We are basically looking at parts of the business that maybe didn't have a certain level of maturity, or care, or focus. Sometimes, it's not that the team doesn't want to do something, is just they were not asked to do something, or it was not part of the business requirement.

What I like about the GPR? It puts customer data, and the care of customer data, at the heart of what companies need to do. And this could either be a massive compliance problem, might as well drag the business or it could be an accelerator. Going back in the car analogy, there a lot of security features in cars, like brakes for example, and other, that actually allow the car to go faster. That's what we want. We want the GPR to be one of those features that actually allows the business to go faster. That allows us to integrate better with third parties, allow us to be much more efficient in how we create new projects. Allow us to share data more effectively and more efficiently, internally and externally. And to do that in more secure way. So, there is a lot of great things that come out of it.

And finally, it will allow us to plan for failure, in a much more efficient way, because we know there'll be issue, the question is how we handle and how we process those issues. So, for me, the Head of Risking Compliance is somebody that will thrive on this challenge, and also has to be quite technical, because a lot of these things are actually very technical. You need to be able to go down to the engineer level and be able to communicate with them and drive you point across.

And the reason why in my head, a perfect candidate has programming experience and knows how to program. This could be python, it could be excel or other things, of course, javascript, scala, would be more interesting. But, when somebody knows a little how to program, it means they are able to be free from the data. They are able to look at a bit of data and go I can automate this, I can program that, and I can visualize this, and I can visualize that. And that's why programming makes the difference. It also a thinking that a programmer tends to have, which the ability to take a very complex problem and break it into small little problems, and solve them in sequence, and put them together again, which is how we program.

So that's kind of my ideal candidate. And the interesting challenge now, it how do we create challenges that allow these properties and this thinking to come out. So, we can create a fair recruitment process that allow the perfect candidate to shine and to be really obvious why that individual is the right one.

One more thing on the Head of Risking Compliance, to be added somewhere in the middle before. The other thing this pro really need is very high focus on details and process, and in law. Basically, this needs to be somebody that geeks reading law document. Somebody that they're definition of a good book is about GPR. That actually finds it funny, that actually enjoys the particularities of the law, and the idea of going to attend and participate on articles, meetings from GDPR, is something they will enthusiastically be looking forward to. And would love to be an active participant in the changing and interacting with those law. Basically, it has to be a geek for law. and rules, the same way that some of our members are geeks for technology and security.
