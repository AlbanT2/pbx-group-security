Referrals are very effective tools to evaluate talent and part of our recruitment process is to find out what makes you tick from people who know you. Because we're leveraging a trust relationship between both parties; between the candidate & the people they know, and between the candidate and the person who reviews them. I would like to see how effective that could be. 

Each candidate needs to find out how they are connected to us via other people. And we can help with that, using graph-based mappings. Is there someone connected with the Photobox Technology Group, or wider, who personlly knows a candidate? If there is a second degree connection, ideally that contact should meet the candidate in person.

This should result in a more interesting and interactive way to vet the candidates' backgrounds and experience to see if they are a good match for the role, the company, and the culture.

In reality, our industry is not that big, so I expect to see three degrees of separation between the candidate and either Group Security, the technology group or the broader Photobox Group.

If you take a pool of candidates, for example the 20-30 strong candidates we have for the Head of Risk and Compliance role, how do we know who to pick? CVs aren't the best way to select the best person, so we need to leverage our connections and find the trust relationships between the various candidates and our contacts. The more of these relationships a candidate can flag, the stronger their position.

If there is a candidate personally known to someone within the business, or they know someone who we trust highly, especially in relation to the roles we are recruiting for, then that connection will be a mark in favour of that candidate. 

This doesn't mean that impressive answers to the challenges are not required. These trust relationships are just another metric that will be used in the candidate selection process. 

My hope is that with LinkedIn and social graphs, and the open data research we will do for every candidate, we will find the best and strongest candidates.

If you have any ideas on how best to do this please provide feedback.
