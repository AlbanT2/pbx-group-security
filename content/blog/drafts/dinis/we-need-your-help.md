## How can you help? Group Security Recruitment Process

Group Security is currently recruiting for six new senior positions and a number of short-term contractors.
We really need your help; the best candidates will be candidates who you already know, who you feel will be an amazing fit for the role, for our culture, and for the work we're trying to do in Photobox Group Security.

We're asking you to reach out to your social network, either in person, by retweeting, or via a blog post, with this information. Refer them to our website, linked below, which contains all the information about the six positions. This is a great opportunity to bring great talent to Photobox, from right across Europe.  One of my key objectives is to recruit across the various Photobox companies, so that the people we recruit will be based not only in the UK, but in the three main countries where Photobox operates, namely France, Germany, and Spain. 

Please review the [job specs](https://pbx-group-security.com/roles) to see if you already know a good candidate, or if you can find one. 

Feel free to contact the security team for help, or with any ideas you might have about the recruitment process. We are planning a number of challenges for the candidates to do; have a look, you might be interested in them yourself!

This process is a journey. We hope to build a strong pipeline of candidates who will be a brilliant fit for our culture and its challenges. We view this as a long-term process that will allow amazing synergies to occur for the benefit of our team and the wider Photobox group.
