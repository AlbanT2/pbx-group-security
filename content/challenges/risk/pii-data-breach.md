By the nature of the business, our servers hold on to our customer's images and personal information i.e. name, address, email address, etc.

The following two scenarios have been provided to you for the purpose of debate.

- Photobox has discovered a data breach that has allowed millions of our customers private images to be exposed online. These images were not available in the public domain and may contain photographs of children, elderly relatives and residential property
- Photobox has discovered a data breach that has allowed millions of our customers name, address, password and email address to be exposed online. There is no credit card or financial information within the data breach

Of these two scarios, which do you deem to be the most serious and why?

**Key Questions**

- Which of the above constitutes PII data?
- Which of the above would you report to the ICO or relevant body?
- Would you contact the customers affected in both scenarios?
