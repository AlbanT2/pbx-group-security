In order to conclusively show first existing security vulnerabilities (and the various ways they can be exploited) and then, 
once the code has been modified to exclude them, how would you set up automated tests?

 - What kinds of things would you include in your tests? How would you replicate the security issues?
 - Would your tests pass or fail when the vulnerabilities exist?
 - How would you ensure that the tests would catch new instances of similar vulnerabilities?
