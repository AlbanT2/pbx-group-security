GitHub is a key part of our workflow with most of the team using its web interface to manage the content
for https://pbx-group-security.com

Your task is to submit the blog post written in the previous task into this GitHub repo

1. fork the https://github.com/project-cx/pbx-group-security repo
2. add your file to a folder inside https://github.com/project-cx/pbx-group-security/tree/master/content/blog
3. create a pull request with that file
