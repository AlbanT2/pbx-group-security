In order to respond to the challenges in a scalable and collaborative way, we
ask candidates to use a Jekyll based website. which will be setup for you.

1. clone the repo https://github.com/project-cx/pbx-candidate-answers
  - if you are happy for your answers to be publicly available, you can just fork it
  - note that GitHub charges for private repos, but BitBucket doesn't
2. set-up dev/test environment (optional, but will help when writing content or modifying the template)
    - if you are running locally, setup Jekyll to run the build (either on your host or using docker).
    - if you are running from GitHub, in your repo settings, set the master brach to host the GitHub pages site
3. add your answers as an entry to `_posts` folder (see examples)
4. push your changes to your repo
5. send us an email to project-cx@photobox.com with a link to  your repo
6. we will reply with more details and a link to an Slack organisation

Note that depending on your CV and how you rate against other candidates, we
will **ask you do submit a couple more challenges**

**Important**: Don't wait until you have all the answers to ping us (step #5). Part of the
evaluation is to see how your work evolve and how we collaborate together
