You are given 5 GB, 50 GB or 500 GB of nginx server logs (pick the one you are most comfortable handling). These logs cover a period when we know a high level vulnerability was exposed.

Your job is to:
a) build an AWS-based infrastructure to consume, query, and visualise the data
b) find proof if that vulnerability has been exploited (and if so, by whom)

Explain the kind of dashboard that you would create and how you would use it to answer the key question(s).

**Objective: Understand and contain issue(s) without any pushes to production**

* You can use any technology you want (ideally ones you have experience with) and any Group Security team size
* Describe what you would do and how you would act (ideally in diagram format)
* Who would you talk to?
* What actions would you take to contain and remediate the issue(s)?

**Resources and Technologies available:**

* Techops, Webops, and Dev teams
* Slack, Jira, Confluence, ELK, Grafana, Nagios, Akamai, AWS, Cisco Firewalls, Landeks, and DarkTrace

#### NOTE: Issues can NOT be remediated in hours
