You are given 5 GB, 50 GB or 500 GB of nginx server logs (pick the one you are most comfortable handling). These logs cover a period when we know a high level vulnerability was exposed.

Your job is to:
a) build an AWS-based infrastructure to consume, query, and visualise the data
b) find proof if that vulnerability has been exploited (and if so, by whom)
c) assume you can use any technology or service required 

Explain the kind of dashboard that you would create and how you would use it to answer the key question(s).
