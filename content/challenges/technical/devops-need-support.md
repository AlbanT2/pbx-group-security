DevOps needs support to secure the AWS Platform. They want to implement a Jump-Host Architecture between the internal network and AWS Platform.

- Draft the Architecture you would recommend to the DevOps Team, including key handling (TLS Keys for the developers to access the platform).

**Objective: Understand and contain issue(s) without any pushes to production**

* You can use any technology you want (ideally ones you have experience with) and any Group Security team size
* Describe what you would do and how you would act (ideally in diagram format)
* Who would you talk to?
* What actions would you take to contain and remediate the issue(s)?

**Resources and Technologies available:**

* Techops, Webops, and Dev teams
* Slack, Jira, Confluence, ELK, Grafana, Nagios, Akamai, AWS, Cisco Firewalls, Landeks, and DarkTrace

#### NOTE: Issues can NOT be remediated in hours
