title: Issues to add
---

List of topics and issues to add to github (useful when working offline or
when going to GitHub will break the dev 'zone' or mojo)

## Ideas and content
- contacts page need to link to our social media presence
  - gs linkedin and twitter
  - personal twitter accounts (for the ones that are happy to publish it)
- add disqus support (I think this already is there)
- create page that maps who is responsible for what in pbx-gs site development
- create GS website brand/design guidelines
- add links to jobs in LinkedIn (we need to push applicants to register there)

## Bugs and Hugo
- add breadcrumbs to pages (so that we can go back to the parent page). At the moment one needs to use the browser Back button
- improve design of banner background (looks too gray and not GS brand aligned)
- remove Bootstrapious. reference at the end of the pages
- site requires 33 requests to load, we need to bring this down to 5 or 6 (via css, js and img consolidation)
- add GA (or another one that is better). Jemma to provide feedback here
- create detatched branch to hold hugo site to be used to submit answers to chalenges and to provide more details about the candidate
