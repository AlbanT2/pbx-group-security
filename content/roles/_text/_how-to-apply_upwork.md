## How to apply

In order to provide a fair and objective recruitment process, before we review your application in upwork, we ask you to perform a number of practical challenges.

This helps us to identify your suitability and experience level.

Each challenge should take no longer than 10 - 15 minutes to complete, however, in order to highlight your key skills, you may take longer than the suggested time if you wish.

Once you have completed your challenges, please submit your application using upwork (see link at the top of this page)
