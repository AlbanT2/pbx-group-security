We’re a restless bunch here at PhotoBox Group. We like to shake things up; look for new ways to deliver exceptional products and services to our customers; and challenge the status quo and each other. It’s about creating, exploring, learning, and growing. 

That means that anything is possible here. And, that’s because we believe in each other. Everyone has a voice here, so we capture the very best ideas. When it comes to putting ideas into practice, we create an environment where we can fail fast and learn quickly. It’s how we do our best work. 

Not that we work alone. We want people to build relationships, to collaborate and tap into the imagination and expertise of everyone across our family of brands. Do that and we win together, creating amazing experiences we’re proud to shout about. 

Put simply, we go all out to create moments that truly wow, surprise and warm the hearts of our customers and each other – every one of us. This is our business. This is how we make magic happen.

#### It takes a particular kind of spirit to work in the Photobox Group.
It’s not for everyone. For a start, we’re a place for self starters and free thinkers. We thrive on each other’s passion for delivering amazing customer experiences, never standing still and constantly challenging the status quo. We look for new and better ways to consistently deliver results and wow customers .

We can be chaotic in our methods and while this is something we’re getting better at, the reality is when you join us, you won’t necessarily have clear structures and processes to guide you. We need people who can carve their own path and even work with others to show us the way. If you see this as the freedom to fly, read on.

What you will get from us is a whole heap of people who want to help you succeed. People who are passionate about seeing our business thrive. People who want to share what they know and what they’ve learned with you. You’ll get the chance to work on projects that are changing the experience for customers and colleagues, and everyone is welcome.

We’re at an exciting time in our evolution. We’re growing up but not growing old. We want people who can take us to the next level. People who have been there and done that, but who are up for doing things differently as well. In return we’ll invest all we can in making sure you get the best from our family of brands. This is a place where you can get your teeth into doing business differently. And enjoy it. Business might be serious, but we don’t have to take ourselves too seriously :)

#### We make it personal, magic is our business
We create moments of magic for our customers, and we do the same for employees too, wherever and whenever we can. We personalise everything, and get to know every member of our team. We’re a big family and we behave that way. 

#### We champion exploration
We build tools and environments where people can share their thinking and explore great ideas across the group. We celebrate people, teams and the work we do together in looking out for new ways to wow our customers. It’s leading by example.

#### We build galaxy's not stars
We open doors wherever we can – encouraging employees to push the limits of their capabilities so we can learn from each other and grow together. We avoid stalemate by creating talent pools that are group wide.

#### We invite everyone to the party
We ensure our diverse workforce always feels considered and included - this is everyone’s business and everyone can get involved. We pull out the stops to be open, share clear goals and celebrate key milestones and achievements across the Group.

#### We raise a smile
We show a sense of humour whenever we can. It’s how we get the most from our people. Because life’s too short to take ourselves too seriously.
